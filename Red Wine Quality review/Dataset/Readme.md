This dataset is taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 
The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

Classification and Regression Algorithms can be applied on the dataset.
